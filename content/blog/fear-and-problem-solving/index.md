Or perhaps, good problem solving and fear exist in inverse proportion – the more fear an individual or the individuals in a group are experiencing, the less able they are to solve problems well. This has clear implications regardless of the domain in which we're trying to solve problems, and sometimes the [stakes couldn't be higher](https://sites.psu.edu/aspsy/2020/10/07/how-groupthink-played-a-role-in-the-challenger-disaster/). But I've never experienced the effect so immediately as I did three days ago, in an environment with no real-life stakes at all.

The Outer Wilds is a videogame, and it's an ideal place for a demonstration of the fear-is-the-mindkiller effect because it is, quite literally, a small galaxy of problems to solve. In a craft that's part NASA, part National Park chic, the player veers from planet to planet in a groundhog-day timeloop, piecing together its secrets before the sun goes supernova. Then, they do it all again, armed only with the knowledge of what came before.

Anyhow, it came out in 2019, and three days ago I made some time to play its recently released expansion, Echoes of the Eye. I raced through problem after problem, building up my understanding of a new world and its inhabitants. And then, the lights went out, and I saw a silhouette against a distant light, and ...

Oh no. Oh _no_.

### The scary owl folk made me dumb

See, two thirds of the way through the game, the tone changes a bit. Things are darker: physically, and in the other sense. Before, I could explore freely, my only opponent the consistent (if consistently punishing) mechanics of a cold unfeeling universe. Now, there were things in the dark. Searching. Pursuing. Snuffing me out.

I got stuck. _Really_ stuck. And I wasn't the only one. Lots of [other people](https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/comments/pz1zqs/does_anyone_else_feel_like_echoes_of_the_eye_is/) got stuck. Some of the game's [reviewers](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/echoes-of-the-eye-is-sensational-dlc-for-outer-wilds-dont-let-anyone-spoil-it-for-you) got stuck.

But I don't think the game got harder at that point. It just got – scarier. The questions the game asks of you are so much harder to answer when your mind, instead of gambolling happily from stepping stone to logical stepping stone, is mostly concerned with avoiding being apex-predatored.

I knew that fear was the mind-killer in principle, but I don't think I've experienced it so clearly in practice. It took some deep, steadying breaths, a fair few retries, and (shamefully) some careful search-engining before I cracked the last puzzle and the universe was set right once again. (1)

Fear sucks. It stops us from thinking clearly. Peter Matthiessian gives us another example of the ancient foundations of this truth in _The Snow Leopard_:

> 'It is this clinging, the tightness of panic, that gets people killed: "to clutch", in ancient Egyptian, "to clutch the mountain", in Assyrian, were euphemisms that signified "to die".' (2)

### Don't be afraid of using these powerful fear-management techniques

In life as in the Outer Wilds, there are things we can do to manage our fear.

In a software engineering context, having a [no-blame culture](https://devops.com/how-sre-creates-a-blameless-culture/) lowers the stakes when things go wrong, and helps us to better learn from failure. Having a clear understanding of the ways a project might fail, for example by running a [project premortem](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/pre-mortem), can lead to a better understanding of risks and how they might be mitigated. And sharing knowledge with techniques like [pair programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html) and [code review](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/code-reviews) can spread responsibility and ownership, which can improve architectural outcomes, reduce the likelihood of failure, and make incidents less scary when they occur.

There are lots of strategies we can use to reduce our fear factor – many more than would be worth listing here – but the important thing is to recognise fear when it exists, understand its negative impact on our ability to think clearly, and take steps to manage it.

At the end of The Outer Wilds, we discover a beautiful piece of thematic symmetry – that spooky alien we have been cowering from is scared, too. And their fear causes them to make a catastrophic error of judgement, a mistake that dooms their kind forever.

Hey! Let's not be doomed. It's reasonable for individuals and teams to feel a few tremors when the stakes are high, or the outcome is unknown. But we can recognise this fear, and cultivate strategies to manage it. Because it's only without fear that we're best placed to solve our problems.
